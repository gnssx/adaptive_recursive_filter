Adaptive Recursive Filter
=========================

An adaptive recursive wideband noise filter using the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm.  
Filter dynamically adapts to changes in signal amplitude and noise value.  
Operates in offline and online modes.

Parameters:
* Number of data samples
* Number of filter co-efficients
* Frequency of input sinewave signal
* Forgetting factor (delta)
* Noise value
* Noise type (uniform or Gaussian)
