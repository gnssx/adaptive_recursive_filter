Adaptive Recursive Filter
=========================

An adaptive recursive wideband noise filter using the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm.  
Filter dynamically adapts to changes in signal amplitude and noise value.  
Operates in offline and online modes.  
Offline mode displays result as a static plot.  
Online mode displays result as an dynamic animated plot.

Parameters:
* number of data samples
* number of filter co-efficients
* frequency of input sinewave signal
* forgetting factor (delta)
* noise value
* noise type (uniform or Gaussian)
